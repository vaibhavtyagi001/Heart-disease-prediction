# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction

This project predicts the likelihood of heart disease using machine learning.  
It uses a dataset of patient health metrics to train and evaluate predictive models.

## Project Overview
Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of death globally.  
Early prediction can help in timely diagnosis and treatment.  
This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts heart disease based on patient health parameters.

The project includes:
- Data preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature selection
- Model training and evaluation
- Prediction on new data

##  Dataset Information
The dataset contains the following features:
- `age` → Age of the patient
- `sex` → Gender (1 = male, 0 = female)
- `cp` → Chest pain type
- `trestbps` → Resting blood pressure
- `chol` → Serum cholesterol level (mg/dl)
- `fbs` → Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true, 0 = false)
- `restecg` → Resting electrocardiographic results
- `thalach` → Maximum heart rate achieved
- `exang` → Exercise-induced angina (1 = yes, 0 = no)
- `oldpeak` → ST depression induced by exercise
- `slope` → Slope of the peak exercise ST segment
- `ca` → Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy
- `thal` → Thalassemia
- `target` → Presence of heart disease (1 = yes, 0 = no)
